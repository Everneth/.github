## Welcome to the Everneth SMP GitHub
You found us. The *different* ones from the rest of the SMP community. We maintain the plugins and bots that help automate and integrate our management processes and systems together to make running the community a simpler and more effecient task. Our main active Repos are the [Everneth Management Interface](https://github.com/everneth/emi), [Jasper the Gatekeeper Discord Bot](https://github.com/everneth/gatekeeper), [Everneth API](https://github.com/everneth/evernethapi), and the [Everneth RP plugin](https://github.com/everneth/emi-rp).

If interested in working on some of our plugins, please contact [TptMike](https://github.com/tptmike) on GitHub (@faceman in Discord).
